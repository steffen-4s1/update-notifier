# Update Notifier

With this repository I get informed about updates of different projects with the help of the Renovate Bot. For this purpose, dummy files are available for the respective projects in the form of a `Dockerfile` or `package.json`.

## How does it works

If there is an update, the Renovate Bot makes a pull request and assigns it to me. As soon as I have taken note of the update, I merge the pull request.
